    You know you're really something, yeah
    <br />
How we get here so damn fast?
<br />
Only you could tell me that
<br />
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
<br />
You're making me forget my past
<br />
Never thought I'd feel like that again
<br />
I came to peace with my path
<br />
Now you got me off track
<br />
I've never been this scared before
<br />
Feelings I just can't ignore
<br />
Don't know if I should fight or fly
<br />
But I don't mind
<br />
Tripping, falling with no safety net
<br />
Boy, it must be something that you said
<br />
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
<br />
Got me tripping, falling with no safety net
<br />
Let your guard down, girl
<br />
You know we came too far now, girl
<br />
It's time for you to play your part now
<br />
You know, we hit that jewelry store and we gon' ball out
<br />
Ups and downs, we had some fall outs
<br />
Get some ice on you girl, let it thaw out
<br />
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
<br />
At the end of the day
<br />
I've never been this scared before
<br />
Feelings I just can't ignore
<br />
Don't know if I should fight or fly
<br />
But I don't mind
<br />
Tripping, falling with no safety net
<br />
Boy, it must be something that you said
<br />
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
<br />
Got me tripping, falling with no safety net
<br />
Every time you feel some way, feel the way
<br />
Never let me run away, run away
<br />
Baby, every time you feel some way, feel the way
<br />
Never let me run away, run away
<br />
Girl you got me tripping, falling with no safety net (baby)
<br />
Boy, it must be something that you said
<br />
Is it real this time or is it in my head? (Is it all in my head)
<br />
Got me tripping, falling with no safety net
